This is the repository of my online-web CV

I wanted to implement a simple but user-friendly webpage for my CV so I decided to shape it like a notebook with some 
post-it looking tabs. 

### Usage
You can navigate through the tabs on your left side by clicking them. You'll find some direct links and some links that are
hided in images which you can click, those are the social media logos.

### Implementation
There is a page for every tab (an html file each one), I put a lot of effort to try to make the web responsive and also 
accessibility for blind people. 

### Final considerations
There is a lot more I would like to improve but I couldn't for lack of time.

Here you have the [Figma design website link](https://www.figma.com/file/E3Pupxr4WfVBsd0HfZVFN3/CV?node-id=0%3A1).
And also a [PDF format](/doc/CV_Figma.svg) of it.
