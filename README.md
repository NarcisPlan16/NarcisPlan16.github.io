This is the repository of my online-web CV

I wanted to implement a simple but user-friendly webpage for my CV so I decided to shape it like a notebook with some 
post-it looking tabs. 

### Project analysis

#### Target user profile
The target of this page are enterprises which are looking for some candidates to a job offer. They expect to find information
relative to my studies, job history and achievements. Also for some soft and hard skills, which depend on what they are 
searching for.

#### Information architecture
As we have a single-page website format, there is no much architecture. The main page is the *index.html* and forim there 
(and the ther secctions/pages) you can access to the other sections. There is no hierarchy.

#### Visual design
Afer doing some research i decided to use a plain and simple color palette, no gradients.
Color palette used:

<img src="/doc/Color-Palette.jpg" width="650" alt="Color palette"/>

Once I had the color palette decided, I proceeded with the design layout:
Here you have the [Figma design website link](https://www.figma.com/file/E3Pupxr4WfVBsd0HfZVFN3/CV?node-id=0%3A1)
and also an SVG format ![SVG format](/doc/CV_Figma.svg) of it.

### Usage
You can navigate through the tabs on your left side by clicking them. You'll find some direct links and some links that are
hided in images which you can click, those are the social media logos.

### Implementation
There is a page for every tab (an html file each one), I put a lot of effort to try to make the web responsive and also 
accessibility for blind people. 

### Final considerations
There is a lot more I would like to improve but I couldn't for lack of time.
